iamsteve.me is a design & code blog, with the goal of helping you to implement your design vision. It’s aimed at designers & developers, looking to improve their visual design & CSS skills.

The website needed a design refresh to accommodate the change in focus—it was balanced between being a blog and a portfolio. As well, there was a need to improve the perception of this website being a place you can depend on to learn.
