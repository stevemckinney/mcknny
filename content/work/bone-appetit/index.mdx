introduction: [
  "Bone Appetit was a new raw dog food company. They needed a website & branding that would get the company into a position to begin taking subscriptions.",
  "Creating the website and branding was the easy part—trying to sell a product from nothing in the pet food industry is the challenging part. So with the design I set out to create a vibrant and harmonious brand, that would stand out."

## Where do you start when there’s nothing?
Initially, there wasn’t a name for the company let alone branding. All of this had to be considered before getting into the design of the website. The main question that needed asking, was how do potential customers trust this product? 

### Make it friendly and approachable
Looking at the various brands out there they take two approaches: friendly over clinical or clinical over friendly. 

I felt a more clinical approach could come across cold and off putting for a new product. As the more minimal brands can have science to back their product, which works for them from the perspective of being an owner. You can buy into that, but a product that has no science or credibility you have to find an edge.

## Raw dog food in a handy package
The main selling point of the product was its ease of use.
