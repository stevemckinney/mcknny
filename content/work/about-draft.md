# Design that keeps you happy & your readers returning

You’ve got a lot of content, but your readers aren’t discovering it. You may see an initial burst as you publish new articles, but that’s it. Your visitors don’t browse many articles. This can be disheartening when you put effort into your writing, after all it’s what you enjoy.

With some changes, you could steadily improve that. Think of your own experiences, you read an article, view a product and it feels off... Maybe it’s the time the page has taken to load, or the line lengths making it a challenge to read.

Maybe it’s all of the distractions, the tracking requests and the poorly timed newsletter bombardment. Throw in some manipulative messaging and you’ve got the perfect negative impression—why would you spend time here?

You see this stuff and think it must work. But what figures does this lead to? High unsubscribe rates? Nonexistent sharing? A reducing conversion rate? It’s possible to grow for the long term without short term tactics.
