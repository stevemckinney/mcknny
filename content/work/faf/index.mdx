introduction: [
  "Fresh Ancoats Foods is a hydroponic farm with a vision to change the way food is grown and delivered. Hydroponic farms can grow more food with less land—however, like traditional farming, you require a similar effort to harvest produce.",
  "While growing the community is the most important goal, it’s in the interests of the company to sell produce. The design aims to promote joining the community, along with an element of growing partnerships for buying produce."
