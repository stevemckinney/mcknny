introduction: [
  "Fresh Ancoats Foods is a vertical farm with a vision to change the way food is grown and delivered. Vertical farms can grow more food with less land—it’s suggested by the name—however, like traditional farming, you require a similar effort to harvest produce.",
  "Growing the community is the most important goal, as without it, produce cannot be harvested and distributed efficiently. The design aims to promote joining the community, along with an element of growing partnerships for buying produce. As the community grows, the aim of the website will rightly shift."
