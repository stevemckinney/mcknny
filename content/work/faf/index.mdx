introduction: [
  "Fresh Ancoats Foods is a vertical farm with a vision to change the way food is grown and delivered. Vertical farms can grow more food with less land—it’s hinted at in name—however, like traditional farming, you still need to harvest produce.",
  "Growing the community is the most important goal, as without it, produce cannot be harvested and distributed efficiently. The primary aim for FAF is to promote joining the community, along with an element of growing partnerships for buying produce. As the community grows, the aim of the website will rightly shift."
