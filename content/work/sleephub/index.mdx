description: A modern internal departmental news website
url: ""
service: ["Design", "Build"]
category: ["Web"]
introduction: [
  "For years Silentnight had an internal website that did a job, but it was very dated, updated infrequently and employees had very little reason to want to visit it.",
  "After a trial with a Wordpress theme went successfully, the challenge was given to improve on this. What was created was a modern news site that allowed each department to have their own area and improve company processes."
