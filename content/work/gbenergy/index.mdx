introduction: [
  "gbenergy were a growing energy company at the time of this project. And needed a redesign of their signup process and account areas, to help take them from small company, to big company who care about customers—with a clear and usable signup process and customer dashboard.",
  "I aimed to make things visually clean and clear as possible. With helpful prompts where necessary, because when you’re stuck, the last thing you want to do is waste an hour on the phone for something that appears trivial."
