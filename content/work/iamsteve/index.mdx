  "iamsteve.me is a design & code blog, with the goal of helping you to implement your design vision. It’s aimed at designers & developers, looking to improve their visual design & CSS skills.",
  "The website needed a design refresh to accommodate the change in focus—it was balanced between being a blog and a portfolio. As well, there was a need to improve the perception of this website being a place you can depend on to learn."

## Understanding the visitors
It’s important to understand the frame of mind people are in whilst looking for solutions in articles. So throughout the process I wanted to keep this in mind.

### Time is the main factor
There are two primary types of people who visit this website. Those who are currently working and those who are learning.

**The distinction between the two is the time they have**. The person working wants a quick solution and the person learning wants to be guided and understand why.

## Understanding the workflow behind content
There was a reasonable amount of articles already on the website—so a workflow is in place. I wanted to see where I could make the design of articles better without increasing workload where possible.

They are very much tutorial led, with the occasional essay.

### Improve the design and aim to increase efficiency
Each post has various assets associated with it. From application images, code samples, keyboard shortcuts and references to name a few things.

These things take time to gather and produce on top of an article alone. However, it’s important to add these extra details—they aren’t only necessary but improve engagement.

<div className="scroll scroll-offset flex full gap-8 mt-16 -mb-16 -ml-1 md:-ml-8">
<Screen device="small" className="snap-start">

</Screen>
<Screen device="medium" className="snap-start">

</Screen>
</div>

## A vibrant & flexible set of colours
Starting out, laying the foundations for producing content and addressing the primary goal is the colour palette.

The aim is to be flexible and remain complementary. I wanted to give  variety in hues, tints and shades so that featured images and illustrations had enough freedom.

<div className="full lg:content mt-16 figure">

</div>

## Custom pixel perfect icons
With the illustrations throughout the website having particular stylistic choices (eg: stroke weight) it made sense that the icons followed suit.

All illustrations are drawn with 2px rounded strokes, so this was the main constraint to adhere to. Each icon is drawn on a 16px grid, being implemented in such a way the colour can be adjusted easily in code.

<div className="full lg:content mt-16 figure">

</div>

## Bold & clear typography, with enough white space
For the design of articles, people reading or scanning articles will benefit from a clear visual hierarchy & lack of distractions.

<div className="scroll scroll-offset flex full mb-8 mt-16 mdMax:-ml-1 md:-ml-8">
<Screen device="small" className="snap-start">

![](./iamsteve-article-small-01.png)

</Screen>
<Screen device="medium" className="snap-start">

</Screen>
<Screen device="medium" className="snap-start">

![](./iamsteve-article-large-02.png)

</Screen>
</div>

Headings are treated like a table of contents—in effect—denoting a new chapter. You can also click the icon next to these headings to grab a link to them.

### It doesn’t stop at design
Design defines a lot of the harmony found within articles, but it goes beyond typography and spacing. It’s up to the creation of content to maintain that experience.

I defined ways to create a more unified feel between list pages & articles themselves efficiently.

- Use the same sizing for featured & in article images
- Even if the image could feasibly take up less space
- Use light shades of the colour palette for featured image backgrounds
- Aim to use one or two distinct colours within featured images
- Set up templates to save having to refer to image sizes & colour

Some of these things appear simple, but it was a challenge to define appropriate sizing for each element. So that it remained in harmony throughout the design.

<div className="scroll scroll-offset flex full mb-8 mt-16 -mb-16 mdMax:-ml-1 md:-ml-8">
<Screen device="small" className="snap-start">

<Screen device="medium" className="snap-start">

</div>

## Results
The design wasn’t just a massive visual improvement, it was a restructuring and refocusing of a website that balanced two competing goals. Focusing on the writing side of the website saw the following:

<div className="grid content grid-cols-10 lg:col-start-3 xxxl:col-start-6 lg:col-span-10 gap-4 md:gap-8 mt-16 mb-10">
  <Story className="col-span-5">
